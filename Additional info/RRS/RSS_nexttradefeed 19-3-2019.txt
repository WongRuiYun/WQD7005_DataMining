Magni: Profits Rose Despite Lower Revenue
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>Results Update</b></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">In QE31/1/2019, Magni's net profit rose 54% q-o-q or 14% y-o-y to RM36 million while revenue was mixed- up 21% q-o-q but down 1.4% y-o-y to RM309 million.<br /><br />Revenue receded slightly by 1.4% y-o-y due to lower revenue from the garment segment (dropped by 1.1% mainly due to lower sale orders received) and lower revenue for the packaging revenue (dropped by 4.2% mainly due to lower sale orders received). Profit before tax improved by 7.7% y-o-y due to 6.4%-increase in PBT from the Garment segment (mainly due to higher foreign exchange gain by RM2.992 million and lower operating expenses incurred) and 46.4%-increase in PBT from the packaging segment (mainly due to lower operating expenses incurred).<br /><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E4z6by42d48/XI-a7A4vHkI/AAAAAAAAv2E/CLiXuvOnak4YEDfxKzmoaReS1zHcjnJwQCLcBGAs/s1600/Magni%2527s%2B8Qs.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="912" data-original-width="717" height="320" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E4z6by42d48/XI-a7A4vHkI/AAAAAAAAv2E/CLiXuvOnak4YEDfxKzmoaReS1zHcjnJwQCLcBGAs/s320/Magni%2527s%2B8Qs.gif" width="251" /></a><br /><i>Table: Magni's last 8 quarterly results</i><br /><br /><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NmpjAqyYZc4/XI-a7POh2vI/AAAAAAAAv2I/VV_UzYWvvtkHCll04aERC58hjCjRz3jkQCLcBGAs/s1600/Magni%2527s%2B48Qs.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="850" data-original-width="580" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NmpjAqyYZc4/XI-a7POh2vI/AAAAAAAAv2I/VV_UzYWvvtkHCll04aERC58hjCjRz3jkQCLcBGAs/s320/Magni%2527s%2B48Qs.gif" width="217" /></a><br /><i>Graph: Magni's last 48</i><i>&nbsp;quarterly results</i><br /><b><br /></b><b>Financial Position</b><br /><br />As at 31/1/2019, Magni's financial position was very healthy with current ratio at 5.4 times and gearing ratio at only 0.14 time.<br /><br /><b>Valuation</b><br /><br />Magni (closed at RM4.66 yesterday) has a trailing PE of 7.5 times (based on last 4 quarters' EPS of 62.15 sen).

BJFOOD: Better Earnings Reported
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>Results Update</b></div><br />For QE31/1/2019, BJFood reported a net profit of RM9.0 million as compared to a net loss of RM11 million incurred in the same quarter last year.

Revenue rose 8% q-o-q or 10% y-o-y to RM181 million.<br /><br />Revenue rose q-o-q mainly due to the calendar year end festive promotions, school holidays and the Christmas season during the third quarter, which contributed positively to the higher profit from operations and pre-tax profit for the quarter under review.<br /><br /><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x7FtN-tmSKI/XItQD-NG9PI/AAAAAAAAv1g/3Ds5kqghIxoUkjRg0zMgxLLG2XJ54cb_QCLcBGAs/s1600/BJFood%2527s%2B8Qs.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="685" data-original-width="711" height="307" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x7FtN-tmSKI/XItQD-NG9PI/AAAAAAAAv1g/3Ds5kqghIxoUkjRg0zMgxLLG2XJ54cb_QCLcBGAs/s320/BJFood%2527s%2B8Qs.gif" width="320" /></a><br /><i>Table: BJFood's last 8 quarterly results</i><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;"></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>If we exclude the extraordinary gain of RM158.6 million recognized in QE31/10/2014, the improved performance in the last quarter became quite clear.

The company announced:<br /><br />Revenue and EBITDA improved on the sustained organic growth at existing operations and contribution from Gleneagles Hong Kong Hospital and Acibadem Altunizade Hospital, both of which opened in March 2017. Amanjaya Specialist Centre and Fortis Healthcare (“Fortis”), acquired in October 2018 and November 2018 respectively, also contributed to the higher revenue and EBITDA. This was despite the offsetting translational effect from a stronger Malaysian Ringgit against the currencies of other countries in which IHH operates. On a constant currency basis, revenue and EBITDA grew strongly by 28% and 33% respectively.<br /><br /><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pPgEotP6j2o/XHajGEM1hbI/AAAAAAAAvwY/eoHD5T-GzioMhBIirJ3WSQOCOp2UARZlQCLcBGAs/s1600/IHH%2527s%2B8Qs.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="581" data-original-width="691" height="268" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pPgEotP6j2o/XHajGEM1hbI/AAAAAAAAvwY/eoHD5T-GzioMhBIirJ3WSQOCOp2UARZlQCLcBGAs/s320/IHH%2527s%2B8Qs.gif" width="320" /></a><br /><i>Table: IHH's last 8 quarterly results</i><br /><br /><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GCbmTG1gRmQ/XHajF5PGahI/AAAAAAAAvwQ/oMB0e8HCN_sGC_DHuW7fTFmbhPYw6Lu7ACLcBGAs/s1600/IHH%2527s%2B31Qs.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="573" data-original-width="564" height="320" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GCbmTG1gRmQ/XHajF5PGahI/AAAAAAAAvwQ/oMB0e8HCN_sGC_DHuW7fTFmbhPYw6Lu7ACLcBGAs/s320/IHH%2527s%2B31Qs.gif" width="314" /></a><br /><i>Graph:&nbsp;</i><i>IHH</i><i>'s last 31 quarterly results</i><br /><br /><b>Financial Position</b><br /><br />As at 31/12/2018, IHH's financial position is deemed healthy with current ratio at 1.9 times while gearing ratio at 0.6 time.<br /><br /><b>Valuation</b><br /><br />IHH (closed at RM5.66 yesterday) is now trading at a PE of 88 times (based on last 4 quarters' EPS of 6.44 sen).

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">This is the 4th day after the big rally on February 20 (<a href="https://nexttrade.blogspot.com/2019/02/market-outlook-as-at-february-20-2019.html">here</a>). With each passing day, the market looks weaker, and our earlier excitement more misplaced. Let's re-examine the chart.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8r2jgrs-u_A/XHTmnI3luGI/AAAAAAAAvuY/hVf9jYMmP60RRY_GifPiPMmJDkit8r-QgCLcBGAs/s1600/FBMKLCI%2Bd20190226_2.58.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="662" data-original-width="999" height="212" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8r2jgrs-u_A/XHTmnI3luGI/AAAAAAAAvuY/hVf9jYMmP60RRY_GifPiPMmJDkit8r-QgCLcBGAs/s320/FBMKLCI%2Bd20190226_2.58.gif" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><i>Chart: FBMKLCI's daily chart as at February 26, 2019_3.00pm (Source: Malaysiastock.biz)</i></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">As discussed on February 20, FBMKLCI broke above a pennant, ABCD at 1710. I expected the index to surge upward to test and break above the downtrend line, RR at 1732. Well, it did not happen. The market was not as bullish as I thought it should be. Now, FBMKLCI is pulling back towards the pennant, ABCD. If it can hold above the breakout level at 1710, it may stage another attempt to breach the downtrend line. We will have to wait and see.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">That's the state of play in the market now. Let's hope the index can stay at or above 1710. If it can do that, the current correction could be a good thing as new players can now gain entry into stocks at slightly lower prices. If players can make pocket money in each market rally, then more players will step forward. With greater numbers, the budding force will swell and eventually it may breach the downtrend line.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

TChong: Earnings Rebounded Strongly
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>Result Update</b></div><br />For QE31/12/2018, TChong's net profit rose 57% q-o-q to RM52 million while revenue dropped 26% q-o-q to RM1.17 billion. The group revenue dropped q-o-q due to lower revenue from the automotive division of RM1,140.7 million (-26.0% QoQ) which was due to lower sales in the absence of the “tax holiday” in Malaysia in the previous quarter. Nonetheless, the group EBITDA rose due to higher EBITDA from the automotive division of RM114.6 million (+29.3% QoQ) due to the favourable sales mix and improved margins.<br /><br /><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kt5QNhq8lhw/XHSIkvdig3I/AAAAAAAAvt8/_kRw3PUQ3joC4XOm-QQiTjZz6hdCuERyACLcBGAs/s1600/Tchong%2527s%2B8Qs.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="630" data-original-width="788" height="255" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kt5QNhq8lhw/XHSIkvdig3I/AAAAAAAAvt8/_kRw3PUQ3joC4XOm-QQiTjZz6hdCuERyACLcBGAs/s320/Tchong%2527s%2B8Qs.gif" width="320" /></a><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Table: TChong's last 8 quarterly results</span><br /><br />TChong's revenue, profits and profit margins appear to have turn the corner in the last few quarters.<br /><br /><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8Zv3n-pb0SE/XHSIk5T4VkI/AAAAAAAAvuE/nMSHWBBnw4QITlRbLGwik3SonbeTe2PsgCLcBGAs/s1600/Tchong%2527s%2B49Qs.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="886" data-original-width="544" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8Zv3n-pb0SE/XHSIk5T4VkI/AAAAAAAAvuE/nMSHWBBnw4QITlRbLGwik3SonbeTe2PsgCLcBGAs/s320/Tchong%2527s%2B49Qs.gif" width="195" /></a><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Graph: TChong's last 49 quarterly results</span><br /><b><br /></b><b>Financial Position</b><br /><br />As at 31/12/2018, TChong's financial position is deemed satisfactory with current ratio at 1.6 times and gearing ratio at 0.9 time.<br /><br /><b>Valuation</b><br /><br />TChong (closed at RM1.48 yesterday) is now trading at a trailing PER of 9.5 times (based on last 4 quarters' EPS of 15.48 sen).

Gamuda & Litrak: Tolled Roads Takeover
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Over the weekend, there were many reports that the Government is in talk to takeover some of the tolled roads and/or to reduce toll charges in the country. The tolled highways being highlighted as the first batch of concessions to be taken over are under Litrak (<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysia-set-to-take-over-four-highways-and-tweak-road-charges-to-reduce-voter-angst">here</a>). At this stage, there is no details on the takeover, such as pricing mechanism etc. The opposition parties are trying to paint the talk of tolled roads takeover as a political gimmick to win vote for the Semenyih by-election.</div><br />Right after GE14, the mere talk of a privatization of tolled roads had caused the share price of Litrak to plunge more than 30% from RM5.50 to RM3.70. I believe the negative sentiment has subsided, and the current round of rumor may have no impact on share price. Let's take a look at Litrak and Gamuda.<br /><br />1) Litrak (RM4.60 @22/2/2019)<br /><br />The share price is capped by a downtrend line, RR at RM4.70. Without any detail being disclosed, Litrak share price is likely to be capped by this downtrend line.<br /><br /><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0ffzOwfkxVY/XHM56I8l2UI/AAAAAAAAvs4/lHqyR0DRkZsd0WIJv-oZNwQFYPJJrrougCLcBGAs/s1600/Litrak%2Bw20190222.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="674" data-original-width="999" height="215" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0ffzOwfkxVY/XHM56I8l2UI/AAAAAAAAvs4/lHqyR0DRkZsd0WIJv-oZNwQFYPJJrrougCLcBGAs/s320/Litrak%2Bw20190222.gif" width="320" /></a><br /><i>Chart 1: Litrak's weekly chart as at Feb 22, 2019 (Source: Malaysiastock.biz)</i><br /><br />2) Gamuda (RM3.04 @22/2/2019)<br /><br />This stock has rallied since the start of the year. It has gone above the downtrend line, RR at RM2.35. Its immediate resistance is at RM3.10. It will probably be driven higher by development in the negotiation on ECRL than takeover of Litrak's tolled road. If it can go above RM3.10, its next resistance will be at RM4.00 (with a short stop at RM3.50).<br /><br /><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8m4s8PHkPKs/XHM56DG_BmI/AAAAAAAAvs0/IRqce--xz1cRFLSe66mnn-hvVLC9989CQCLcBGAs/s1600/Gamuda%2Bw20190222.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="674" data-original-width="999" height="215" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8m4s8PHkPKs/XHM56DG_BmI/AAAAAAAAvs0/IRqce--xz1cRFLSe66mnn-hvVLC9989CQCLcBGAs/s320/Gamuda%2Bw20190222.gif" width="320" /></a><br /><i>Chart 2: Gamuda's weekly chart as at Feb 22, 2019 (Source: Malaysiastock.biz)</i><br /><br />I recommend a HOLD and a BUY ON WEAKNESS on both stocks.<br /><br /><b>Quick Update</b><br /><b><br /></b><b>As at 9:45 am, Litrak was down 32 sen to RM4.28 and Gamuda was down 29 sen to RM2.75. The sell-down is very strong- driven by fear and misconception. Even my fellow remisiers came to my room and told me, these 2 stocks are to crash. I reminded them that Malaysian economy is a free enterprise economy, with rules and laws. If the Government were to takeover these highways, the concession owners will be compensated. The question is only the quantum of the compensation. If the Government can simply takeover a private asset without compensation, we will be on the road to economic perdition.&nbsp;</b>

Revenue in current period increased 8% compared to the immediate preceding quarter mainly due to the increase in export sales by 6.4% from USD 47 million to USD 50 million and slight appreciation of USD against RM by 2% (4th Qtr 2018 :4.16; 3 rd Qtr 2018: 4.08).

Market Outlook as at February 20, 2019
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Our market had a big rally today. FBMKLCI rose 19.62 points to close at 1726.18. The rally was fairly broad-based with 724 gainers and 252 losers.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">From Chart 1, we can see that FBMKLCI broke above the pennant formation, ABCD at 1706 as well as the horizontal line at 1710. Tomorrow, we may see FBMKLCI rising to meet the downtrend line, RR (at 1729) which dates back to April 2018. The next resistance will be the 200-day SMA line at 1740.

Good luck.

KPJ: Profits Continued to Rise
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>Result Update&nbsp;</b></div><br />For QE31/122018, KPJ's net profit rose 29% q-o-q but dropped 12% y-o-y to RM53 million while revenue rose 5% q-o-q or 4% y-o-y to RM863 million. Group revenue rose 4% y-o-y mainly contributed by the increase in number of patient visits, number of beds and surgeries particularly for KPJ Rawang, KPJ Pasir Gudang and KPJ Bandar Maharani. A total of 14 new consultants from various disciplines joined the Group which contributed to an increase of 7% for its inpatient and outpatient treated at our hospitals. Extended promotions to the neighbouring countries and online promotions and marketing strategies were also factors to the increase in revenue.<br /><br />Profit before zakat and tax increased 5.4% y-o-y due to lower negative EBITDA reported by the Indonesian operation (RM1.5 million vs RM7.2 million&nbsp;previously) which offset the drop in profit before zakat and tax in the Malaysian operation from RM90.2 million&nbsp;to RM86.1 million&nbsp;as well as higher negative EBITDA reported by the discontinued Australian operation (RM4.7 million&nbsp;vs RM0.5 million previously).<br /><br /><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fhlPsUj975M/XGv-RnE_PlI/AAAAAAAAvq4/0lFcFjkMwNQdZ0GumVIM9UQRFreKCS9TwCLcBGAs/s1600/KPJ%2527s%2B8Qs.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="530" data-original-width="656" height="257" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fhlPsUj975M/XGv-RnE_PlI/AAAAAAAAvq4/0lFcFjkMwNQdZ0GumVIM9UQRFreKCS9TwCLcBGAs/s320/KPJ%2527s%2B8Qs.gif" width="320" /></a><br /><i>Table: KPJ's last 8 quarterly results</i><br /><br />KPJ's quarterly revenue has been on a steady uptrend for the past 10 years. Its earning has been flattish in the past 5-6 years due to expansion program which led to lower profit margin as higher administrative expenses were not fully absorbed by revenue from the newly hospitals opened. However profits &amp; profit margins seem to be curving upward.
