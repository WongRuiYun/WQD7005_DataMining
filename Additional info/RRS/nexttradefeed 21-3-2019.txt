Redtone: Higher Earning Due to Higher MTNS Revenue 
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>Result Update</b></div><br />For QE31/1/2019, Redtone's net profit increased by 116% q-o-q or 7-fold to RM5.4 million while revenue rose 52% q-o-q or 66% y-o-y to RM45.4 million. Revenue rose q-o-q due to higher revenue from Managed Telecommunication Network Services ("MTNS") segment. The Group's profit before tax rose q-o-q due to higher revenue in the MTNS segment (see Table 2 below).<br /><br /><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NCVitGKdMwI/XJDfiSDqZ6I/AAAAAAAAv38/z1IIEpfXZogGl7EnuTz8IFMY8MKOGUBvACLcBGAs/s1600/Redtone%2527s%2B8Qs.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="510" data-original-width="627" height="260" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NCVitGKdMwI/XJDfiSDqZ6I/AAAAAAAAv38/z1IIEpfXZogGl7EnuTz8IFMY8MKOGUBvACLcBGAs/s320/Redtone%2527s%2B8Qs.gif" width="320" /></a><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Table 1: Redtone's last 8 quarterly results</span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cbDHetjuJCE/XJGNM2svGLI/AAAAAAAAv4c/kHY416u7KrAIjZZJDZZCO2hZBd9gHxMsgCLcBGAs/s1600/Redtone%2527s%2Bsegmental%2Bperformance%2BQE31Jan2019.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="368" data-original-width="506" height="232" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cbDHetjuJCE/XJGNM2svGLI/AAAAAAAAv4c/kHY416u7KrAIjZZJDZZCO2hZBd9gHxMsgCLcBGAs/s320/Redtone%2527s%2Bsegmental%2Bperformance%2BQE31Jan2019.gif" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-style: italic;">Table 2: Redtone's segmental results for QE31/1/2019&nbsp;</span><br /><br />From Table 3 below, we can see that MTNS segment is now catching up with the Telecommunication Services segment.

Dayang's Correction: Nothing Out of the Ordinary
I read Mr. Koon's article entitled <b>Dayang: Devious Tricks to Buy at Cheaper Prices</b> (<a href="https://klse.i3investor.com/blogs/koonyewyinblog/198495.jsp">here</a>) with amusement just before the market re-opened in the afternoon. I re-read the article 5 minutes ago and was simply stunned by the concluding remark:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><strong><span style="background: white; color: #333333;">Unless the author, editor, directors and Kenanaga (sic) Investment Bank can confirm that they do not have Dayang share, I will not believe the published article is not another skilful use of underhand trick to buy Dayang at cheaper prices.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></blockquote>That was a very strong statement from Mr. Koon. He was referring to this report by Kenanga entitled <b>Dayang Enterprise Holding- Take Profit From This Rally</b> (<a href="https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/ptres/49755.jsp">here</a>).<br /><br />Mr. Koon has rightly called a BUY on Carimin earlier and followed up on that success with a buy call on Dayang. Both calls were spot on, and he moved in quickly to build up a big position which proved to be very profitable.<br /><br />I do not agree with his strongly-worded attack on Kenanga. Kenanga is in the business of advising the clients on maximizing their profit- be that short-term or long-term. Any one with a few years of investing experience can tell you that Dayang has overshot its fair value past few days and was due for a correction. The Kenanga analyst, who I have not met even though we are "colleagues", merely pointed out that the risk of a correction may out-weigh the risk of further price gain. Thus, it is sensible to take some profit and wait for a lower price to re-enter the stock or to re-deplore the sale proceed to another stock which may give a better return.<br /><br />Having said that, I'm always a big fan of Mr. Koon. His analysis are both sharp and incisive, and most importantly he put his money where his mouth is. I wish Mr. Koon continued success in his investment, and look forward to more sharing from him.

O&G Play to Take a Break
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The first sign that O&amp;G play was long in the tooth was when Perdana -which is related to current champion of the O&amp;G, Dayang - started to <strike>moe</strike> move up on Mar 13.</div><br /><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3PZzbUAdTZY/XJBXvtmVTWI/AAAAAAAAv3g/REaRSeXxT_4GrL-Jhw2sMGHssxtcJAGMwCLcBGAs/s1600/Perdana%2Bd20190319_10.43am.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="659" data-original-width="999" height="210" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3PZzbUAdTZY/XJBXvtmVTWI/AAAAAAAAv3g/REaRSeXxT_4GrL-Jhw2sMGHssxtcJAGMwCLcBGAs/s320/Perdana%2Bd20190319_10.43am.gif" width="320" /></a><br /><i>Chart 1: Perdana's daily chart as at Mar 19, 2019_10.43am (Source: Malaysiastock.biz)</i><br /><br />Today we saw the champion, Dayang breaking its "psychological level" of RM1.50.<br /><br /><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bh2zKWq5eE0/XJBXvkrznbI/AAAAAAAAv3k/4iiEgRQ1EqkqIb7NTYz5y-Tf_entPNyRwCLcBGAs/s1600/Dayang%2Bd20190319_10.43am.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="659" data-original-width="999" height="210" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bh2zKWq5eE0/XJBXvkrznbI/AAAAAAAAv3k/4iiEgRQ1EqkqIb7NTYz5y-Tf_entPNyRwCLcBGAs/s320/Dayang%2Bd20190319_10.43am.gif" width="320" /></a><br /><i>Chart 2; Dayang's daily chart as at Mar 19, 2019_10.43am (Source: Malaysiastock.biz)</i><br /><i><br /></i>There will be technical rebound here and there as those who missed out on the play will try to get. I think this correction can be very deep and bloody. It is better to ignore the temptation to buy into the falling O&amp;G stocks for next few days.

Market Outlook as at March 19, 2019

This downtrend line and the line connecting the lows since 2010 (as shown in the weekly chart above) are about to converge, thus providing us with the answer to the perennial question: What's next?! Shall it be an upside breakout or a downside breakout or more of the same sideways movement? Looking at the weak ADX in the DMI, I will not be surprised that we may see more sideways movement ahead.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VVZZktJwcY4/XI-beSH7onI/AAAAAAAAv2c/3mTcsmrh_vcusq8w8oQeB9To8afjvwULgCLcBGAs/s1600/FBMKLCI%2Bd20190318.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="659" data-original-width="999" height="210" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VVZZktJwcY4/XI-beSH7onI/AAAAAAAAv2c/3mTcsmrh_vcusq8w8oQeB9To8afjvwULgCLcBGAs/s320/FBMKLCI%2Bd20190318.gif" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><i>Chart 2:&nbsp;</i><i>FBMKLCI's </i><i>daily chart as at Mar 18, 2019(Source: Malaysiastock.biz)</i></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">Notwithstanding this lackadaisical market outlook provided by the FBMKLCI, our market will still serve up regular bouts of rotational play depending on the flavor of the market players. January was the month for construction stocks. February &amp; March have been kind to O&amp;G stocks. Will building material and property stocks be the next hot things? We will have to wait &amp; see.</div>

Domestic sales continues to be strong post GST tax holiday period as the Group is still anchored to meeting unfulfilled customers booking comprising mostly of the CX-5 and CX-3 models as a result of the Group's offer to absorb the SST for bookings received prior to 1 September 2018 but vehicle delivery made after the re-introduction of SST.<br /><br />The Group pre-tax profit improved by RM8 million or 9% mainly due to increase in the Group's revenue, partly offset by lower gross profit margin from both the domestic and the Philippine operations.<br /><br /><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FcBeLqZlPMk/XIj9raZSk0I/AAAAAAAAv08/CKGPEPHTw2c3JxoDMG3FtWTzMQI6BG7AACLcBGAs/s1600/BAuto%2527s%2B8Qs.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1284" data-original-width="691" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FcBeLqZlPMk/XIj9raZSk0I/AAAAAAAAv08/CKGPEPHTw2c3JxoDMG3FtWTzMQI6BG7AACLcBGAs/s320/BAuto%2527s%2B8Qs.gif" width="172" /></a><br /><i>Table: BAuto's last 8 quarters' financial performance</i><br /><div><br /></div><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yf-81Ix1KbU/XIj9rbxO2bI/AAAAAAAAv1A/VOE5dEpLa-IN0LcTJHf-uvHs21ZDVAc_ACLcBGAs/s1600/BAuto%2527s%2B27Qs.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="948" data-original-width="586" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yf-81Ix1KbU/XIj9rbxO2bI/AAAAAAAAv1A/VOE5dEpLa-IN0LcTJHf-uvHs21ZDVAc_ACLcBGAs/s320/BAuto%2527s%2B27Qs.gif" width="196" /></a><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Graph: BAuto's&nbsp;</span><i>last 27 quarters' financial performance&nbsp;&nbsp;</i><br /><b><br /></b><b>Financial position</b><br /><br />As at 31/1/2019, BAuto's financial position is deemed satisfactory with current ratio at 2.2 times and total liabilities to total equity at 0.8 time.<br /><br /><b></b><b>Valuation</b><br /><br />BAuto (closed at RM2.24 yesterday) has a fair PER of 10 times (based on last 4 quarters' EPS of 22.61sen).
